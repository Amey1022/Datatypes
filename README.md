# Datatypes
## Aim
To study and implement c++ program structure (Data Types)
## Theory
<BODY>
Fundamental data types in C++ define the basic types of data that can be manipulated by programs. They include:  <br>
Integer Types:  <br>
int: Typically represents a signed integer with a size that depends on the system architecture (commonly 4 bytes).<br>  
short: Typically smaller than int (commonly 2 bytes).  <br>
long: Larger than int (commonly 4 or 8 bytes).  <br>
long long: Larger than long (commonly 8 bytes).  <br>
Floating-Point Types:  <br>
float: Single-precision floating-point type, typically occupies 4 bytes.<br>  
double: Double-precision floating-point type, typically occupies 8 bytes.  <br>
long double: Extended precision floating-point type, larger than double (size varies by implementation).<br>  
Character Types:  <br>
char: Typically represents a single byte (8 bits) that can hold one character from the ASCII character set.<br>
